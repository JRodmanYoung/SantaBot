# SantaBot

SantaBot is a web application whose goal is to create assignments for a 'secret santa' gift exchange. This project is ongoing, but the core functionality is present in the niceListAlgorithm.py script. This project employs a SQLite database and an API built with the Flask framework.

Running SantaBot requires that the flask application framework is installed.
